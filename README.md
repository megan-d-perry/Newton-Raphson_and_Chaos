# Newton-Raphson_and_Chaos

When applied to functions with no real roots, the Newton-Raphson method produces a sequence of complex numbers that may converge to a complex number, 
oscillate between two or more values, or even diverge to infinity. These sequences can be visualized in 2D and 3D using color-coded plots.

One way to visualize the output of the Newton-Raphson method in 2D is to color the complex plane based on the behavior of the sequence 
generated by the method. Points that converge to a root are colored black, while points that oscillate or diverge are assigned a unique color. 
In this way, a complex pattern emerges that is unique to the function being analyzed.

The Newton-Raphson method is not only useful in mathematical and scientific contexts but can also be applied to machine learning problems.
